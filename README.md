# Rock Paper Scissors in Python

A basic rock paper scissors game that runs in the terminal coded with Python. It's interesting to see the differences between coding this type of project in Python vs JavaScript. In a way, I prefer the Python version since I find it more comprehensive and an overall more enjoyable coding experience.
